# Foundation-Models
Tricks and coding in Large Language Models. The main topic covered in the blogspot will be about tect analysis, classification, topic modelling, RAG and text embeddings. Finally, the plan is to paired this with a tutorial on Explainable LLMs, using attention, advanced chain of thoughts methods but also MechInterp.

# The code is made using Python 3.9 and PyTorch 2.6.1

Please have a look on the necessary packages that needs to be installed. Soon a list of requirements will be provided. 

# Running on the GPU and CUDA 11.4
