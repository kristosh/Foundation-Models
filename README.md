# Foundation-Models
Tricks and coding in Large Language Models. The main topic covered in the blogspot will be about tect analysis, classification, topic modelling, RAG and text embeddings. Finally, the plan is to paired this with a tutorial on Explainable LLMs, using attention, advanced chain of thoughts methods but also MechInterp.

# The code is made using Python 3.9 and PyTorch 2.6.1
